As a final project in my Software Design class, our team created a Super Smash Bros Clone in __Python__ that was playable over online multiplayer.

Super Smash Bros is a crossover fighting game series originally developed by Nintendo. However, instead of depleting an opponent's health bar, the goal is to increase their damage and eventually knock them off of the stage with a powerful attack.
